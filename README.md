# Module 8 Challenge ETL
The project task is to provide weather information for list of randomly selected cities and closet hotels based on minimumum and max temperature preferences.

## Summary of Tasks
### Deliverable 1
* Generate a sample of 2,000 random latitudes and longitudes
* Retrieve the nearest city using citipy
* Obtain weather information using an API call to OpenWeatherMap
* Save the cities and weather data to WeatherPy_Database.csv within the Weather_Database folder

### Deliverable 2
* Obtain user info for minimum and maximum temperature preferences
* Using the data saved in WeatherPy_Database.csv, create DataFrame for cities that meet the minimum and maximum temperature crtieria
* Using Google Maps API, identify nearest hotels to those selected cities
* Add hotel info pop-up box data for each of those cities
* Save the updated cities information to WeatherPy_vacation.csv within the Vacation_Search folder
* Display Google Map with hotel name and weather information in markers

### Deliverable 3
* Select four (4) cities close in proximity to one another and in the same country
* Display a map of the cities with directional layer
* Display a map of the cities with hotel name and weather information in markers
